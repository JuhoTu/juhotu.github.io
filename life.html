		<h2>If you happen to be interested in my personal life, here are a few of those listed</h2>

		<p>Starting things from the beginning I was born in Lappeenranta, Finland in 1998 and lived my first years at Imatra. Just before my first baby brother was born we moved to Lappeenranta. I now have a total of three baby brothers. Side note: I permit any harmful usage of information in this site towards me or people around me.
		I was always about average in primary and secondary school. My strong subjects were mathematics, Finnish and English. Later on secondary school I chose IT basics as an optional and had my first coding experiences with HTML and Visual Basic and had a first touch on media creation other than just Office suite products.
			<br><br>
		When I was 15 I built my first computer with help of my dad. At the time I also introduced myself to video editing which I really liked doing. I remember doing one video for art project and getting a ten out of ten grade from it.
		I made a simple cube game when I was around 15 and I have it saved <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!At97rHqJ-ZLaga9kUEUybnlq8dmOwg?e=tsI4iO" target="_blank">here</a>. I also experienced with Unreal Engine but that was only for fun.
		I started vocational school in 2014 and went to Finnish high school at the same time (it's called double degree in Finland). I learned more about what I can do with computers in that time but I also began to learn about myself too.
			<br><br>
		My whole life I have been very shy, but when I got my first job I had to start speaking louder and more often which eventually led to me not being so anxious about opening my mouth. I graduated in 2017 and continued doing the same job until the end of the year.
		I joined the army I/18 and did not like my time being there very much. Being asthmatic and allergic to many things my lungs especially did not enjoy but I 'graduated' or moved to reserve whichever is the correct term after six months. Then I had a few months off time and went back to my old job.
