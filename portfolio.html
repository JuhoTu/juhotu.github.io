            I have a vocal qualification in Business IT degree and I am currently studying Business Administration with major in IT at LAB University of applied sciences. I have studied languages such as Finnish, English, Swedish, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, PHP,C#. I also have experience with MySQL, Access, Windows and Linux server, WordPress and obviously many hours on various Office365 applications. C# has been the most interesting to work with by far I think and I am a bit interested to try Swift and overally programming for Mac or iOS as those are the platforms I'm mostly using.
