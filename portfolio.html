    <h1>Showcase for some of my work!</h1>

    <img src="image/prof-1.jpg" height="450" width="337"/><h3>I have a vocal qualification in Business IT degree and I am currently studying Business Administration with major in IT at LAB University of applied sciences. I have studied languages such as Finnish, English, Swedish, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, PHP,C#. I also have experience with MySQL, Access, Windows and Linux server, WordPress and obviously many hours on various Office365 applications. C# has been the most interesting to work with by far I think and I am a bit interested to try Swift and overally programming for Mac or iOS as those are the platforms I'm mostly using.
    </h3>

    <h3>My workexperience is being an Apple service technician at iTronic Lappeenranta for over four years. During that time I have finished my vocal qualification degree and finnish high school and had about 10 months off work which of 6 months I spent in the army. I started my university of applied sciences studies at Fall 2019.</h3>
